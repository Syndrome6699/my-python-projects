Phone Number Verifier

This Python script verifies phone numbers to check if they are valid or invalid using the phonenumbers library while also indicating the carrier name. The valid and invalid phone numbers are filtered into separate text files for further processing.

Requirements
To run this script, you will need Python 3.x installed, along with the phonenumbers library.

Installation
Install the required Python library:

To install the phonenumbers library, you can use either pip or conda. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

Using pip:
pip install phonenumbers

Using conda:
conda install -c conda-forge phonenumbers

Save your phone numbers:
Create a text file (e.g., phone_numbers.txt) in the same directory as this script.
The file should contain one phone number per line. The phone numbers can be in any valid international format.

Example (phone_numbers.txt):
+14155552671
+447911123456
+919167776543

Ensure the script and the text file are in the same directory.
